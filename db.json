Developers will increasingly focus on building faster, more accessible, and personalized web experiences using frameworks like React, Svelte, and tools like AI-assisted coding. With the rise of progressive web apps (PWAs), headless CMSs, and seamless API integrations, the line between native and web applications will continue to blur, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible on the web."
